# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to explore the unsupervised machine learning process, using Crypto-Currency data as the base set.

This project required we complete the following steps:

#### Deliverable 1
-  Obtain Crypto data from CryptoCompare
-  Read the data into a DataFrame.
-  Clean the data, eliminating Coins not being mined, traded, and any null values located.
-  Standardize the data to void skewed results.

#### Deliverable 2
-  Apply the PCA algorithm to the dataset in order to reduce data dimensions to to 3 principal components.

#### Deliverable 3
-  Create an elbow curve to determine the most efficient value of K.
-  Run the K-Means algorithm to predict K clusters.
-  Create a new DataFrame to hold this clustered prediction data.

#### Deliverable 4
-  Create 2D and 3D visualizations of final data to interpret the predictions from Deliverable 3.
